# WDIO JSON Steps Reporter

> A WebdriverIO plugin. Report results in json format with steps and screenshot support.
> This project was derived from the 'wdio-json-reporter' found [here](https://github.com/fijijavis/wdio-json-reporter)

## Usage

### Log a step
Import the step function to be used during tests and page object actions
* @param {StepOptions} stepOptions : The options, can be used to override the page object actions 
* @param {string} description : The description explaining what is being done in the task.
* @param {string} expectation : The expected result of the task.
* @param {string} actual : The actual result if the task passes.
* @param {Function} task : The actions to be completed to determine if the test step passes or fails
```javascript
import { step } from "wdio-json-steps-reporter"
...

it("should have the correct title", function() {
    page.verifyPageTitle() //defaults = {createStep: true, takeScreenshot: false}
    page.verifyPageTitle({createStep: false) // no log will be generated in the report, the tasks will still be executed
    page.verifyPageTitle({takeScreenshot: true})
    page.verifyPageTitle({customDescription: "Override the description", customExpectation: "Override the expectation"}))
})


verifyPageTitle(stepOptions?: StepOptions): void {
    step(stepOptions, 
        "Verify the page title is correct",
        "The page title should be correct",
        "The page title was correct", () => {
        const title = browser.getTitle()
        expect(title).to.equal("WebdriverIO Â· Next-gen browser and mobile automation test framework for Node.js")
    })
}
```


### Step Options
The options, can be used to override any default page object actions steps that have been created. Defaults = {createStep: true, takeScreenshot: false}.
```javascript
    type StepOptions = {
        createLog: boolean;
        takeScreenshot: boolean | WebdriverIO.Element;
        customDescription?: string;
        customExpectation?: string;
        customActual?: string;
    };
```


### Installation

NPM
```bash
npm install wdio-json-steps-reporter --save-dev
```


### Configuration

Require the reporter in the wdio configuration file. 
```javascript
const StepsReporter = require("wdio-json-steps-reporter")
```

##### Use the reporter
Configure wdio to use the required StepsReporter as a reporter. It is recommended to supply a unique value to ensure historic test records are kept especially when utilizing the react report dashboard to get the full benefits of it's features
* @param {string} outputDir : The directory where the results will be logged. 
```javascript
reporters: [
    [StepsReporter.reporter, {
        outputDir: `./results/${version}`,
    }]
]
```

##### Merge results to single file
Finally on the completion of test execution use the required mergeResults function to generate a single JSON file which can be utilized by the react report dashboard. Alternatively you may wish to call this from a script as part of npm test. It is recommended to supply a unique value to ensure historic test records are kept especially 
when utilizing the report dashboard to get the full benefits of it's features
* @param[0] {string} : The outputDir where the results were logged by the StepsReporter. 
* @param[1] {string} : The filename to be used for the generated single JSON file: defaults to Date.now()


```javascript
onComplete: function(exitCode, config, capabilities, results) {
    StepsReporter.mergeResults(`./results/${version}`, `${version}.json`)
}
```
